      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        My name is Asuanti, and I am a junior full-stack developer bringing you different forms of creativity and development. I have strengths and weaknesses just like everyone else, but my goal is to create unique experiences for users with out-of-this-world designs and vibrant colors.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        I have a passion for music and sports, and I want to incorporate these interests into my designs to create user-friendly experiences for everyoneâ€”whether it's for the whole family or just individuals who enjoy a bit of fun and creativity.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        I believe that good design should not only look great, but also feel intuitive and engage the user on a deeper level. My mission is to combine aesthetics and functionality to build projects that people love to interact with.
